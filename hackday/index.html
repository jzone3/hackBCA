                        <h2 class="main-answer" style="text-align:center;">It's a precursor to hackBCA II that allows students to see what a hackathon is really like without making the full 24 hour commitment. Participants will have the opportunity to attend various workshops for beginner languages and apply the knowledge learned right away during the hackathon. It also provides an environment for seasoned hackers to work on new projects or continue an existing project they've worked on before. Free lunch, dinner, and swag will be distributed throughout the event. It's an awesome opportunity and you should definitely come! See you there.</h2>

Well, at these 30-45 minute sessions, we will bring in talented individuals and professionals to teach you about something new. Whether it is a language you've yet to learn, or an extremely useful library or software that you never imagined existed, these workshops are intended for you to learn all about them. They're quick, helpful, and to-the-point, so that you won't lose much time attending them and so that you will be able to apply what you've learned right away.</h3>
